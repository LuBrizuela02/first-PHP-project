# 📚 Course Portal - PHP Project

This is my first project using **PHP**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**, created as part of the **Professional Backend Developer Diploma - UTN**.

The website simulates a course portal, where users can select courses and calculate the total amount to pay, both in **Argentine pesos** and **US dollars**. It demonstrates basic backend and frontend concepts, including:

- Sending data via the **GET** method
- Use of control structures in PHP
- Custom functions
- Native PHP functions (`include`, `round`)
- File separation for better organization (header, footer, etc.)
- Styling with CSS3
- Deployment on **InfinityFree**
